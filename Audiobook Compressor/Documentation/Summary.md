## Project Summary: Audiobook Compressor

### 1. Project Goal
To create a standalone, distributable C# WPF desktop application named **Audiobook Compressor** that compresses a user's audiobook library.

### 2. Current Status
The project is now at version 1.2.0, Stable. The UI/UX is finalized, all file/documentation conventions are enforced, and the project is ready for release or further feature work. No code changes since last version except header and documentation updates.

### 3. Core Logic Source
The functional logic for file processing must be ported from the provided PowerShell script: `AudiobookCompressor-v6.2.ps1`. This script is the definitive "ground truth" for the core compression logic. All `ffmpeg` commands, file processing order, and logic (e.g., mono copy threshold) should be ported directly from this script.

### 4. UI/UX Philosophy
* **Minimalist Default View:** The application is designed to be clean and uncluttered on launch. All settings and logs are contained within collapsible `Expander` controls.
* **Dynamic Headers:** The `Expander` headers are not static labels. They should be updated programmatically to provide a dynamic summary of the current settings or the latest log message.
* **Functional Aesthetics:** The UI uses standard, functional WPF controls. Consistency in alignment, color, and size (e.g., ensuring buttons and `ComboBox`es have the same height) is a key principle.
* **Finalized Vertical Spacing:** All vertical spacing and layout is finalized per Praxis directive (Focus 2.2.6.md).

### 5. Key Technical Decisions
* The six main compression settings are implemented as `ComboBox` drop-downs within a `WrapPanel` for a responsive layout.
* **Audio Channel Configuration:**
    * Defaults to Mono for audiobook optimization
    * Supports Stereo for maintaining original quality when desired
    * Channel selection affects mono copy threshold behavior
    * Channel state is tracked centrally in Settings class
* **ComboBox Input Handling:**
    * Editable ComboBoxes (`BitrateComboBox` and `ThresholdComboBox`) support:
        * Direct value selection from dropdown
        * Manual text input with Enter key confirmation
        * Value persistence on focus loss
        * Automatic unit formatting (k, Hz)
        * Immediate UI feedback
    * Non-editable ComboBoxes provide:
        * Instant state updates
        * Proper value persistence
        * UI synchronization
* **Settings State Management:**
    * All configuration options are centralized in the Settings class
    * Default values are provided for all settings
    * Options are exposed as read-only collections
    * Settings changes trigger UI updates automatically
    * Values are properly formatted before storage and display
    * State changes are immediately reflected in UI
* **UI Responsiveness:**
    * All user inputs trigger immediate UI updates
    * Value formatting is consistent across all inputs
    * Settings summary updates in real-time
    * Error handling prevents invalid inputs
    * Focus handling ensures value persistence
* The application's bitrate control logic is based on **ABR** (Average Bitrate) to align with the PowerShell script. VBR is a potential future feature.
* When **CBR** (Constant Bitrate) is selected, it must be a **1-pass** encode. The UI enforces this automatically.
* The application processes ten specific audio formats: `.m4b`, `.mp3`, `.aac`, `.m4a`, `.flac`, `.ogg`, `.wma`, `.wav`, `.webma`, and `.opus`. DRM-protected files are out of scope.
* **Error Handling:** The application implements comprehensive null checking and path validation:
    * Tool paths are resolved with proper error handling for missing directories
    * All nullable references are explicitly marked and handled
    * External tool dependencies are verified before startup
    * Path operations include safeguards against null references
* **UI Best Practices:**
    * ComboBox items are properly bound to data sources
    * Text formatting is consistent across the UI
    * UI elements handle overflow gracefully
    * Settings summary provides clear feedback
    * Input validation occurs in real-time
    * User feedback is immediate and clear
* **Async Pattern Implementation:**
    * File operations use async/await pattern consistently
    * Process handling follows Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP)
    * IAsyncEnumerable used for streaming file processing
    * UI remains responsive during long-running operations
* **Type Safety:**
    * Explicit namespace usage prevents ambiguity
    * Proper type casting in event handlers
    * Null-safe access patterns
    * Clear separation of WPF and Windows Forms types

### 6. Project Workflow & Conventions
* **File Headers:** All project files must adhere to the structure defined in `Documentation/FileHeaderConvention.md`.
* **State Management:** Any modification to a file automatically sets its state to `Experimental`. The `Stable` tag is only to be used for deliberate releases **at the user's explicit request**.
* **Versioning & Branching:** Each experimental change iterates the patch version number (e.g., `1.0.9` -> `1.0.10`). Stable, milestone releases get a major/minor version bump (e.g., `1.1.x` -> `1.2.0`), are tagged `Stable`, and are pushed to the `main` branch on GitHub, **only upon explicit instruction from the user**. Ongoing work occurs in the `experimental` branch.
    * **Note on File Versioning:** Any time you edit a file its individual patch version ticks up. When a stable release is pushed to the `main` branch, all files tick over to the same release version (e.g., `1.2.0`).
    * **Note on Versioning Logic:** Patch and minor versions are incremented sequentially as whole numbers. For example, version `1.1.9` is followed by `1.1.10`.
* **Documentation:** A `Changelog.md` file will log all changes, and this executive `Summary.md` will be kept current as a handoff document.
* **Nullability:** The project uses C# nullable reference types. All nullable members must be explicitly marked with `?` and properly handled with null checks.

### 7. Next Immediate Steps
No immediate code changes required. Project is ready for release or further feature work. All documentation and file headers are up to date as of v1.2.0.

### 8. Directives for AI Collaboration
To ensure consistent and accurate contributions, any collaborating AI must adhere to the following directives:

1.  **Principle of Strict Adherence**: All rules and conventions outlined in this document are mandatory. Do not deviate from or make assumptions about these instructions.
2.  **Follow Document References**: When this document refers to other project documents (e.g., `Documentation/FileHeaderConvention.md`), you are required to read that document and apply its rules and conventions as if they were written here directly.
3.  **Verify Context**: Before making any changes, confirm you have the full and correct context of the current task and the latest versions of all relevant files.
4.  **Timestamp Procedure**: Use the placeholder `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm PLACEHOLDER` for timestamps. A separate process will replace the placeholder with an actual timestamp.
5.  **Comprehensive Application**: Apply all relevant rules in a single, comprehensive action to maintain consistency and minimize iterative corrections.
