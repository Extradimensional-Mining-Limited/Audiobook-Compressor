### **Subject: Final UI Alignment (Ref: Focus 2.2.2.md)**

Sir Fixalot,

The implementation of the contextual UI is excellent and functionally correct. This directive contains one final, minor layout adjustment to ensure perfect visual alignment.

### **Objective: Ensure Consistent Alignment**

The goal is to ensure the new contextual panels for file handling align perfectly with the main compression settings panel above them.

### **Required XAML Change (**MainWindow.xaml**)**

1. **Create a Parent Container:**  
   * In the GroupBox for "Compression Settings," locate the two new panels you created: MonoModeOptionsPanel and StereoModeOptionsPanel.  
   * Wrap both of these panels inside a single, new parent container. A Grid is recommended for this.  
2. **Apply Consistent Margin:**  
   * The new parent Grid (which now contains both contextual panels) must have the **exact same** Margin property as the WrapPanel that holds the main compression settings.  
   * This will ensure that the radio buttons and the override settings panel are perfectly left-aligned with the main settings ComboBoxes, creating a clean, professional look.

No other changes to the logic or control structure are required. This is purely a layout adjustment.

Please implement this change.
