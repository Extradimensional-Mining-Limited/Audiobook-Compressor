### **Subject: Analysis of UI Refactor Plan (Ref: Focus 2.2.1.md)**

Sir Fixalot,

Thank you for your thorough analysis of the directive. Your implementation plan is correct and accurately reflects the requirements outlined in Focus 2.2.0.md. Your understanding of the task is fully aligned with ours.

This document provides the clarifications you requested.

### **Answers to Questions & Clarifications**

1. **Q: Should the override WrapPanel be collapsed or hidden?**  
   * **A:** It must be **Collapsed**. Please use Visibility.Collapsed to ensure the panel takes up no space in the layout when it is not active. This will prevent any empty gaps in the UI.  
2. **Q: Should the override controls be reset when toggling off "Advanced...", or should their state persist?**  
   * **A:** The state must **persist**. The user's configurations in the advanced override panels are valuable. Toggling the "Advanced..." option off should only hide the panel (Visibility.Collapsed). The settings within must be preserved for the current session and saved to the settings file for the next session. This is a critical part of the user experience.  
3. **Q: Any specific styling or margin/padding requirements?**  
   * **A:** The primary requirement is **consistency**. The new WrapPanel containing the radio buttons and the WrapPanel for the override controls should use the same Margin as the main compression settings WrapPanel above them. This will ensure they all share the same left alignment and have a consistent vertical spacing, creating a clean, unified look.

### **Approval to Proceed**

Your implementation plan is approved. You may proceed with the UI refactor as outlined in your analysis and clarified by this document.

We look forward to reviewing the result.
